### The task is to code the attached screen (InVision) using React.js with pixel perfect fidelity.

Main objectives:

1. The plus at the bottom adds another cell - a popup appears with the option to enter the text content of the cell, after confirming the content, the popup disappears and a cell is created.
2. Plus in the Ethnicity part adds another cell to the Ethnicity part - the same operation as above.
3. Minus to the right of Ethnicity - removes the entire part of Ethnicity.
4. The other minuses remove the cell in which they are located.
